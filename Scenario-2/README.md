Rough Idea (Copied from README2.md):

A credit reporting organizarion which stores all credit card details of the users(name, address, phone number, email, bank/loan details, credit score, credit card details) is  hosted on a web application. 

Part 1:
An attacker is trying to exploit the webapplication which gives access to the docker container hosting the backend application server.

Part 2:
Attacker will try to gain access to docker enginee using the exploited container

Part 3:
Attacker gains the access to docker enginee by exploting a vulnerability(docker based vulnerabilty only)

Part 4:
Attacker tries to access the container hosting database to get sensitive info
